optipoolware uses the same shares.db and poolware_explorer.py as poolware_dappie.py - it is a drop in replacement
miner.py will not work with optipoolware, you need to use the provided optihash.py which has miner.txt for configuration.
optihash.py can be run from a device without bismuth installed providing you have python 3.5 (as per wallet), connections.py and picklemagic.py
There are compiled executables for windows and linux
The linux executable was compiled with nuitka on ubuntu 16.04 lts
